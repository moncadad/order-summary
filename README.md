## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
Nothing specific stood out this project however I am proud of myself for
continuing to use React. Although it's a bit overkill for small component
projects like this. I do believe if I was to add to this project it could become
far more useful.
```

```css
Breakpoints and sizing for the layout are becoming easier to figure out.

sass

I'm not accustomed to using sass for styling, avoiding bacrackets and semicolons felt unusual.
Eventually halfway through it came with ease I found it helpful not having to repeath path selectors.
I'm not sure if i'll continue to use, but from reading the sass documentaion it appears theres itermediate tactics that could be very useful.

```

```js
  only js used in this project was the one used to compile react and sass other than that I myself did not make use of any.
  Maybe next project I'll challenge myself to not use react or pseudo selectors, and really make myself putt in the work.
```

### Continued development

I'd like a deper understanding when it comes to sizing, widths, breakpoints, I'm aware there is property called clamp that would be beneficial to learn.
I'd like to implement more js scripting I've done a limited amount up to this point.
